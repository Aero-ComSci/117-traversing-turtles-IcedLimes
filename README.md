# What does it do?
This code creates a class called Manager that creates turtles with different shapes and colors by iterating through a list and using the values within them. It forms a spiral pattern by moving the turtle in a different direction every time the sprite changes and increasing the distance traveled by each turtle to create an outward moving spiral. The __str__ method outputs the description of every type of different sprite using the sentence structure shape: "", color; "".
